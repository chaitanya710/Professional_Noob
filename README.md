Professional Noob - A Learner's Guide To Programing

Maintained by [Skand Tandon](https://github.com/skandtandon)

# Professional Noob
## A Guide for learners

# Intro

## What is this?
This is a highly-opinionated, curated guide to becoming a programmer, with a focus on fullstack web development. I originally wrote this to give some guidance to my friends. Feel free to share or offer suggestions for improvement.

## Who is this for?
This is written for people who don’t have a strong background in programming and computer science, and are trying to figure out if they want to pursue a career using programming. Usually termed as Noobs by the community .

## Why is it opinionated and curated?
I think exploring the world of programming-related careers can be really confusing to noobs, and it can be very easy to get lost, become overwhelmed by decision paralysis, or simply procrastinate.

This guide is aimed at helping out people with a specific goal of becoming a programmer by giving them a simple plan to follow, reducing choices to a handful of options selected for quality and effectiveness, and providing advice on how to actually go about the whole process.

## Some caveats
Pretty much everything in this guide is my own opinion. For conciseness, I will not be providing caveats about how certain things are my opinion elsewhere. I may omit some things. I may also be inaccurate or flat-out wrong about some things. I’m not perfect, and neither is this guide. Caveat emptor.

## Why Professional Noob?

Professional Noob as the name suggest is someone who doesn't know much and act without thinking something which i was once coined with, now a badge I wear as my telegram username. Similarly, this guide is meant to lead you on the journey to becoming a programmer.

## The Plan
### Level 1: Intro (2 - 6 weeks)
Try programming to figure out if a programming career is right for you.
* Step 1: Pick a first programming language (1 day)
* Step 2: Work through a short intro programming course (14 - 45 days)
* Step 3: Decide if you actually want to become a professional programmer (1 - 7 days)

### Level 2: Beginner (3 months - 4 years)
Follow a program to learn and develop useful skills in programming.
* Step 4: Research and pick an in-depth learning program (1 - 2 weeks)
* Step 5: Work through the learning program. (3 months - 4 years)

### Level 3: Intermediate (3 - 5 years)
Get a programming job, and continue to improve your skills.
* Step 6: Self-teach while you prep and apply for jobs (1 month - 12 months)
* Step 7: Use your work to improve your skills (1+ years).

### Level 4: Advanced (1 lifetime)
* Step 8. Do good in the world; hack the planet (1 lifetime)

# Level 1 - Step 1
## Pick a First Programming Language (1 day)
Much ado is made about picking a first language. There are many good choices but I’m going to narrow them down for you.

Here is a list of languages, along with generally what kind of job(s) you would likely be able to get with competency in that language:

- Javascript: Front-end web dev, full-stack web dev
- Python: Back-end web dev, data scientist, data engineer

You will be sticking with this language until you finish a short programming course (14 - 30 days). Once you’ve picked, don’t switch languages until you finish the intro course. In fact, don’t switch languages unless you hate the language you’ve been learning and can pick out a language that you’re really excited to learn. When you're first starting out, being consistent and gaining fluency in a single language is important.

You have until the end of today to pick a language. To help you get oriented, you may want to read a little about programming from the [r/learnprogramming FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq).

If you have hit the end of the day without choosing a language, I’m going to pick for you: Congratulations, you’re going to learn Python!

## More Info
Below is more information about the languages, to help you make up your mind.
### Javascript
#### Pros
- Extremely popular
- Easiest to get a decently-paying job

#### Cons
- Kind of a quirky language, even with a lot of modern improvements, so:
	- It’s a little harder to pick up as a first language
	- It can be a little difficult to pick up other languages
- Constant, rapid change in the ecosystem can be tiring to keep up with

#### Job prospects
- Web development
	- Is basically the only language used for front-end web development
	- Can be used for back-end web development
	- Lots of startup jobs use JS primarily, as do a fair amount of jobs at mid-size and large companies
- Mobile & desktop apps - a small but rapidly growing area

### Python
#### Pros
- Very popular
- Easy to learn
- Translates pretty well to learning other dynamic languages, and to a lesser degree compiled languages
- Really useful in technical assessments.

#### Cons
- Fewer jobs than Javascript (but still a lot!)
- Slower development in the ecosystem

#### Job prospects
- Back-end web app dev
- Data science
	- Moderately difficult to get a well-paying job in data science without a college degree due the need to have other specialized skills (good knowledge of algorithms & data structures, statistics, theoretical math, etc.)

# Level 1 (Intro) - Step 2
## Work through a short intro course on programming (14 - 45 days)
## Instructions
Decide whether you want to learn primarily through a video lecture series or a book/text-based course. If you're not sure, try the video lectures first. Start the course for your language and start working through the program as fast as possible.

## Rules
- Until further notice, you are now banned from copy-pasting any code. Every bit of code you use must be hand-typed. This will help you ingrain programming syntax into your brain.
- Your goal every day is to work at least 5 minutes per day EVERY DAY. Use a timer to make sure you do at least 5 minutes.
- Use a paper calendar to make sure you hit your goal every day and remind yourself.
- If you screw up and skip a day or days, forgive yourself and then, that day, return to doing 5 minutes of work every day.
- Set up a time when you are supposed to start working on the course every day. Stick to that time.

## Courses

### On completion
Congrats, you should now have a handle on the fundamentals of programming!

# Level 1 (Intro) - Step 3
## Decide if you want to pursue a tech career (1 - 7 days)
Now that you've finished the intro course, it's time to sit down and figure out if you want to seriously pursue programming as a skill and tech as a career. Spend time researching and considering carefully.

If you do, keep using this guide. If not, bail and figure out what else you want to do with your life.

# Level 2 (Beginner) - Step 4
## Choose an in-depth learning program (7 days - 14 days)
So you’re going for it, and committing yourself to learning programming and building a career in tech. This is a serious commitment of time, energy and money, and you should put effort into figuring out a primary way to develop employable skills. Set up some coffee interviews to find out more about the industry and how to develop your skills. Read posts on r/cscareerquestions and r/learnprogramming to see what other people have to ask and say.

The options to consider are:

- Self-study
- Coding bootcamp (3-12 months)
	- In-person
	- Online
- Courses at your local community college
- Post-baccalaureate program at a university (1-4 years)
- Bachelor’s degree at a university (4 years)
	- In-person
	- Online
- Master's degree at a university (1-2 years)
	- In-person
	- Online

## Coding Bootcamps: Things to Consider
Whether coding bootcamps are worth it is a hot-button issue. Here are some considerations if you're thinking about going to a bootcamp. I will definitely say that there is a huge variance in quality between bootcamps, so if you decide to go this route, choose carefully.
- Cost
	- How much is it?
	- Do they have scholarships, grants, or fellowships you could apply for?
	- Would you need to take out a loan? What would the rates be for this loan?
- Program application deadlines & start dates
	- Bootcamps usually run by cohorts so you’re going to be limited by timing.
- In-person or online
	- In-person
		- Pros
			- You get a lot more guidance and will likely learn faster
			- You have the social pressure of showing up and working every day, so it’s way harder to procrastinate.
		- Cons
			- It’s significantly harder to get into a good school.
			- You’re limited by the amount of good schools in the area (usually 1-3 in a small city, 3-8 in a big city)
	- Online
		- Pros
			- Cheaper
			- Less stressful typically
		- Cons
			- Easier to slack off and/or procrastinate
			- Slower learning pace
- Quality of the bootcamp & instructors
	- What do people who’ve gone through the bootcamp or worked at it say about it? How recent are their comments?
	- What is the general recent reputation for the bootcamp online, on Reddit, on Hacker News, and on SwitchUp, and Course Report?
	- How difficult is it to get in?
		- The best programs are fairly selective, with a somewhat difficult interview process. You need to study for these. The ones you can get into without studying are usually not worth your time and energy.
- Duration of the program
	- Programs usually run anywhere from 3 months - 1 year.
- Full-time vs. part-time
	- Full-time: You’ll learn at a very fast pace, and be prepared to get a tech job much faster
	- Part-time: You’ll be able to learn at a slower pace and thus pick up more stuff, and 
- What is the bootcamp going to teach you?
	- What’s the tech stack?
	- What kind of jobs will you be prepared for?
- How much help will they give you in getting a job afterwards?

## Self-Directed Learning
Ok, from here onwards we're going to assume you're going with entirely self-directed learning, although everything in this plan will still be useful to those going a more traditional route.

#### In-Depth Learning Programs
Check out the five in-depth learning programs listed below, and choose one to work on.
- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
    * FCC covers HTML, CSS and Javascript, and covers a wide range of topics.
    * FCC works primarily through interactive browser exercises.
    * Choose Free Code Camp if you want to aim to be a fullstack Javascript developer.
* [App Academy Open](https://open.appacademy.io/)
    - App Academy Open covers Ruby/Rails, Javascript, and HTML/CSS.
    - App Academy Open has a lot of material, but is potentially more difficult to navigate without a mentor.
    - Choose App Academy Open if you want to be a Rails and Javascript developer, and you have access to a mentor/instructor.
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
    * The Odin Project covers Ruby/Rails (optionally), Javascript, and HTML/CSS, similar to App Academy Open, but has less material and is possibly easier to navigate alone.
    * The Odin Project does a good job of covering the developer tooling ecosystem, and has you work in parallel on your own PC rather than in the browser.
    * Choose the Odin Project if you want to aim to be a Rails and Javascript developer, and you don't have a mentor to work with.
- [Harvard's CS50 Intro to CS](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) followed by [CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-web-programming-python-and-javascript)
    + CS50 is an excellent program, and will ingrain more computer science fundamentals into your learning than the other programs. The tradeoff is that this track will take longer than the other programs to get you job-ready.
    + CS50 uses C, Python, and Javascript.
    + Choose CS50 if you want a solid CS base and you aren't in a rush to get a job immediately.
* Aalto University's [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course
    * Full Stack Open is aimed at people with some experience with Javascript already and focuses only on Javascript.
    * Choose this program if you feel like you have a good base in Javascript and HTML/CSS and want to be able to move quickly on to the next level.

# Level 2 (Beginner) - Step 5

* [Stack Overflow Jobs](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs)
* [Github Jobs](https://jobs.github.com/)
* [Triplebyte](https://triplebyte.com/)

### Build a personal site/portfolio
Build yourself a personal site or portfolio page. Add personal projects you're proud of, with clean code and documentation.

### Improve your résumé
Take a look at what [Career Cup's sample résumé](https://careercup.com/resume) looks like.

### Learn data structures & algorithms
You may have noticed by now that the madness of technical interviews focuses on algorithms and data structures. On your own time, study up with an eye out for applying this knowledge to interviews.

If you prefer video lectures:
* [Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.udemy.com/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/)
* [MIT's Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/): This course is taught with Python

If you prefer reading a book:
* [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms): This book is in Python, but does not focus on language-specific stuff.
* [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html): The authors provide a free interactive version of the book online, along with video instructions on some in-chapter exercises.

Alongside either, browse this:
- [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university/)
- [Coding Interview Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/TSiege/Tech-Interview-Cheat-Sheet)
- [Competitive Programming Syllabus](https://gist.github.com/sharmaeklavya2/8aa2830f3a46a3f46ff249b4e1f07767)

### Read surveys
Reading surveys related to your field helps you understand it better. Check out these surveys:
* [Stack Overflow Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/)
* [State of Javascript Survey](https://stateofjs.com/)
* [Jetbrain’s Python Developer Survey 2018](https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018/)

### Read news and culture
Immerse yourself in aspects of technology culture like programming, software engineering, hacking, and tech startups through subreddits, Hacker News, Medium groups. This will generally help you understand more about what you’re getting yourself into, help you orient your priorities, and start to accumulate a general knowledge of useful resources. In addition, it will help you “talk the talk” when you get to the job application stage, so you can be in-the-know about the tech scene.

Be careful not to spend too much time on this - no more than 30 minutes per day. This is not as important as studying and programming.

At some point along this way, you should be able to get a job. Congratulations!

# Level 3 (Intermediate) - Step 7
## Use your work to improve your skills (1+ years).
Keep pushing yourself to improve. Figure out what you want to specialize in and how you can continue to educate yourself.
